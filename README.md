# Hospitality Data Analysis Insights (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Excel, Power BI, Power BI Service
## Problem Statement
Star Grand Hotel in Buea had a marked rise in cancellations and no-show reservations, erratic occupancy rates, and irregular booking patterns. Additionally, the hotel noticed variations in revenue among platforms and room classes, but it was unable to provide definitive explanations for these variations. Demand forecasting was further hampered by seasonal fluctuations, which made efficient resource planning challenging. Furthermore, it was difficult to see how various booking platforms and room types affected overall performance. It was difficult to monitor important indicators, comprehend visitor behavior, and pinpoint problem areas impacting income and occupancy in the absence of trustworthy performance tracking.

## Create dynamic dashboards to display:

- What is Total Revenue and WoW change %
- Show Occupancy and ADR trends
- Compare Noshow rates and cancellation analysis
- Show RevPAR and realisation % trends
- Analyze Booking trends by platform and room class

## Performance Reporting Requirements
- Generate reports summarizing key findings on:
- Revenue, occupancy, and ADR trends
- Platform and room class performance
- Areas for optimization (e.g., reducing noshows and cancellations)

## Solution
This project addresses these challenges through a comprehensive data analysis approach, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), key metric tracking (Revenue, ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy), and Week-over-Week (WoW) performance evaluation. By analyzing patterns in bookings, cancellations, platform usage, and room class preferences, the goal is to uncover actionable insights that drive smarter decision-making.

# Key Insights
## Overall Performance & Capacity
## Total Capacity: 
The hotel has a total capacity of 954K.
## Occupancy Split: 
Weekend occupancy is 18% with a 70% realization rate, while weekday occupancy is lower at 13% with a 70% realization rate.
## Revenue Difference: 
Weekend revenue per room is higher ($\text{1,751.67}$ vs. $\text{1,726.28}$ for weekdays). This suggests that while weekday occupancy is lower, the pricing strategy or demand is relatively stable, with weekends driving higher volume and slightly better revenue per room.

## Booking Platform Performance
# Dominant Platforms: 
The "others" category accounts for the largest share of bookings at 41%, followed by MakeMyTrip at 20%. This suggests a strong reliance on a diverse set of channels beyond major known OTAs (MakeMyTrip, Goibibo, TripAdvisor, Journey) and direct channels.
## Direct Channel Share: 
Direct online and direct offline bookings together account for only 15% ($\text{10%} + \text{5%}$), indicating a low percentage of commission-free bookings.

The dashboard above also depicts that:
## Key Rates Over Time
## Cancellation Rate: 
The cancellation rate fluctuates, averaging around 25% or 24%. This is a relatively high rate and a significant area for potential revenue loss.
## No Show Rate: 
The No Show Rate is lower, at about 5%, which is a positive sign, but still contributes to lost revenue.
## Occupancy Rate Fluctuation: 
The Occupancy Rate time series shows high volatility, frequently spiking and dipping, indicating a lack of consistent demand or perhaps heavy reliance on short-term/last-minute bookings.
## Dashboard Below
The final deliverables include dynamic dashboards and performance reports that provide a clear view of business performance, highlight areas for optimization, and support data-driven strategies for increasing guest satisfaction and profitability.
## Performance by Category/Segment
## Luxury vs. Business: 
Luxury category in both Douala and Buea contributes significantly higher total revenue and successful bookings compared to the Business category in the respective cities.Buea Luxury: $\text{75,503,040 FCFA}$ total revenue, $\text{70\%}$ Realization Rate.Douala Luxury: $\text{61,719,330 FCFA}$ total revenue, $\text{71\%}$ Realization Rate.

# Final Conclusion
The "STAR GRAND HOTEL" has a substantial capacity but is suffering from low overall occupancy (around 14-18%) and a very high cancellation rate (around 25%).
The most critical area for improvement is the high cancellation rate. Reducing this rate would directly increase the realization rate, successful bookings, and overall occupancy without needing to acquire new demand.

Furthermore, the hotel should:

- Analyze the "others" booking platform segment to identify the specific channels and their cost/commission structure.

- Focus on growing the direct booking channels to reduce commission costs and improve profitability.

- Investigate the reasons for the high volatility in the Occupancy Rate to stabilize demand and move towards more consistent performance.

- Leverage the strong performance in the Luxury segment and the high occupancy in Douala to further optimize pricing and capacity allocation.
