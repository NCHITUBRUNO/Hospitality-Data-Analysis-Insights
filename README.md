# Hospitality Data Analysis Insights (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Excel, Power BI, Power BI Service
## Problem Statement
Star Grand Hotel in Buea had a marked rise in cancellations and no-show reservations, erratic occupancy rates, and irregular booking patterns. Additionally, the hotel noticed variations in revenue among platforms and room classes, but it was unable to provide definitive explanations for these variations. Demand forecasting was further hampered by seasonal fluctuations, which made efficient resource planning challenging. Furthermore, it was difficult to see how various booking platforms and room types affected overall performance. It was difficult to monitor important indicators, comprehend visitor behavior, and pinpoint problem areas impacting income and occupancy in the absence of trustworthy performance tracking.

## Create dynamic dashboards to display:

- What is Total Revenue and WoW change %
- Show Occupancy and ADR trends
- Compare Noshow rates and cancellation analysis
- Show RevPAR and realisation % trends
- Analyze Booking trends by platform and room class

## Performance Reporting Requirements
- Generate reports summarizing key findings on:
- Revenue, occupancy, and ADR trends
- Platform and room class performance
- Areas for optimization (e.g., reducing noshows and cancellations)

## Solution
This project addresses these challenges through a comprehensive data analysis approach, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), key metric tracking (Revenue, ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy), and Week-over-Week (WoW) performance evaluation. By analyzing patterns in bookings, cancellations, platform usage, and room class preferences, the goal is to uncover actionable insights that drive smarter decision-making.
